Abstract: 
Background
One of the most comprehensive approaches to depression is the biopsychosocial model. From this wider perspective, social sciences have criticized the reductionist biomedical discourse, which has been dominating expert discourses for a long time. As these discourses determine the horizon of attributions and interventions, their lay interpretation plays a central role in the coping with depression.

Methods
In order to map these patterns, online depression forums are analyzed with natural language processing methods, where computational tools are complemented with a qualitative approach. Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model of depression-related posts from the most popular English-speaking online health discussion forums (N = ~70 000) reveals the monolog (attributions and self-disclosures) and interactive (consultations and quasi-therapeutic interactions) patterns.

Results
Following the evaluation of various models 18 topics were differentiated: attributions referring to health, family, partnership and work issues; self-disclosures referring to contemplations, introducing the experience of suffering and well-being, along with diaries of everyday activities and hardships; consultations about psychotherapies, classifications, drugs and the experience; and quasi-therapeutic interactions relying on unconditional positive regards, recovery helpers experience or spirituality. These topics were evaluated from the perspective of the biopsychosocial model: the weight of each dimension was measured along with the discursive function.

Conclusions
Biomedical discourse is underrepresented in lay discussions, while psychological discourse plays an overall dominant role. Even if actors are initially aware of the social mechanisms contributing to depression, they neglect these factors when it comes to considering the countermeasures.
