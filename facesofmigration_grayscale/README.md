## Labs name
Faces of migration

## Labs description
In recent years news about refugees became part of our everyday lifes. In our analysis we explore pictures from such articles published in online media between 27.09.2014. and 11.06.2016. The aim of our project is to provide insights about the topics the pictures could be centered around, and to check what could the faces on these pictures tell us.
