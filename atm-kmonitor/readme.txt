CSS
----------

The theme stylesheet is css/style.default.css. If you want to make any changes, you can do it here or better to override it in custom.css so you can update the original theme stylesheet if an updated is released.

Javascript
----------

Apart from Bootstrap JS components, the majority of JS is located in /js/front.js. 

Credits
